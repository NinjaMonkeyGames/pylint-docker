## What is this repository for? ##

The purpose of this repository is to maintain control over versions of Pylint. This maintains uniformity when enforcing
coding standards and formatting rules. This allows for easier upgrades and prevents newer versions from breaking the
pipeline.

---

## Configuration information ##

There is a '.pylintrc' file containing the Pylint configuration in the root of the project directory. You can
use the following YAML line to copy this into your project directory.

```shell
cp /app/.pylintrc $GITHUB_WORKSPACE
```

Alternately you can use the following command to use your own configuration file.

```shell
find . -type f -name "*.py" -print0 | xargs -0 pylint
```

See links below for more information about pylint and Alpine Linux.
